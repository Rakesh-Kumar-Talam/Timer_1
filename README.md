# ⏰ Timer App

A simple and user-friendly Timer App built with **Android Studio** and **Kotlin**. This app allows users to create multiple timers with custom labels, which are saved within the app. Users can start timers by clicking the label button, which triggers a background clock to run.

- Add labels for each timer (e.g., Study, Workout, Cooking).
- Persistent storage — timers remain saved even after closing the app.
- Start timers by pressing the label button; the background clock begins.
- Easy-to-use, clean user interface.
